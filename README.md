# Poly-Advanced-Module-1
We are working on a large NFT project and also we will deploy an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain.
## Overview
The project aims to demonstrate the process of creating a collection of NFTs using DALLE 2 or Midjourney, 
storing the items on IPFS using pinata.cloud, deploying an ERC721 or ERC1155 contract to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet, 
and then transferring the NFTs from Ethereum to the Polygon Mumbai network using the FxPortal Bridge. 
This project showcases the integration of multiple technologies and blockchain networks to achieve cross-chain NFT migration.
## ERC721 Goerli to Mumbai Bridge Using fxPortal
To successfully complete the challenge, the project should meet the following criteria:
### Steps for Bridging
1. Utilize the DALLE 2 or Midjourney models to generate a collection of 5 distinct NFT images.
2. Store the generated NFT images on IPFS using the pinata.cloud service for decentralized and persistent storage.
3. Develop and deploy a smart contract on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet that supports either ERC721 or ERC1155 NFT standards.
4. The contract should include a promptDescription function that returns the prompt used to generate the NFT images.
